# Homelab Infrastructure Repo

This repository houses the infrasturcture definitions for my homelab. Its a 
work in progress and may contain bugs / incompatibilities. 

The homelab is built on a proxmox hypervisor which needs to be installed before 
moving onto installation. 


## Installation 

Navigate to the terraform directory. 

For now, populated the config.yaml file with appropiate values. 

```sh 
cd terraform 
terraform apply 
```


## Next Steps
1. Tie in Ansible for K8 Installation 
2. Update Remainder of Proxmox manual steps to terraform 
3.
